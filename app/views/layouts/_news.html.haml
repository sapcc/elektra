      #### Flash messages dismissible

      Flash messages have changed. Now:

        * flash.now[:success] --> will be auto dismissible

        * flash.now[:info] --> will be auto dismissible

        * flash.now[:warning] --> dismissible clicking the X button

        * flash.now[:danger] --> dismissible clicking the X button

        * flash.now[:default_{type}] --> you get the default flash message, no dismissible button and not auto dismissible.

      Help texts are meant to be a bit more verbose than just tooltips but shouldn't be too long. The idea is to give some extra hints for the most common question a user might have and to provide links to the complete in-depth documentation from there. As an example look at the compute/instances plugin. The help text there is just about the maximum length we want for this. Adding the help text works similar to the help text for the webconsole. So you add a file to the plugin root folder as follows:

      Instructions:

      Create a markdown file using the following naming scheme:

      plugin_(service_name_)help.md

      So either plugin_help.md for a plugin wide help, or plugin_service_name_help.md (e.g. plugin_instances_help.md) for cases where more than one service lives in the same plugin and you need servivce specific help text.

      Similar for the links:

      plugin_(service_name_)help_links.md

      See the compute plugin for an example (especially the links file, it requires a special syntax for cc internal links, e.g. to the documentation).

      #### Mark Plugins as experimental
      You can now mark plugins as experimental:

      1. In your controller add a private method `experimental` and have it return `true`
      2. Once plugin isn't in an experimental state anymore, remove the method

      ```
      private

      def experimental
        true
      end
      ```

      #### WebConsole Help Text for Plugins
      In your plugin's home folder (i.e. next to the Readme file) create a file
      `webconsole_help.md`

      If your plugin contains multiple "sub plugins" with different CLIs or commands  (e.g. the Block Storage plugin contains volumes and snapshots) you may also create a file with the following pattern:

      `webconsole_<controller_name>_help.md`
      e.g. `webconsole_snapshots_help.md`

      The webconsole goes from highest specificity to lowest when figuring out which help to display. So if a file exists named after the current controller it will take that one, otherwise it will take `webconsole_help.md` from the plugin. If neither of those exist it displays a generic help we have created as a fallback.

      And add your help text in the file. Follow the template established in the Compute plugin (which clients are available for this plugin, CLI help commands, often used commands).

      #### Stylesheets

      Made a change that stylesheets in engines are partials (name starts with underscore). This ensures that imports in the core application stylesheets are also available in the engines.

      **What does it mean?**

      You won't have to import compass or variables or other stylesheets from the core app to reuse them in your engine anymore.

      I have cleaned out al existing plugin stylesheets to reflect this.

      #### Main Toolbar Content

      I have changed how the Maintoolbar content works. It is now more of a breadcrumb which renders the current hierarchy. <code>content_for :main_toolbar</code> now only affects the last crumb of the hierarchy. Therefore it can't contain <code>h1</code> anymore. Also, if no content for the main toolbar is defined in the view then I will print the selected service name.

      #### Inline Spinner

      I added a class you can add to a span to get a spinner inline with some text. Usage:

      ```
      %span.spinner
      ```

      **Example:**

    %p
      Here is some text with an inline spinner
      %span.spinner

      #### Polling Service

      It is now possible to get DOM elements updated automatically (polling).
      To use polling service you have to modify your code on two places, in view and controller.
      View:
        You should set two data attributes.
        * update_path, this path should return a piece of html without layout
        * update_interval, delay in seconds between updates (5 seconds steps, e.g. 5, 10, 15, 60)

        Example
        <code>.inquiries-container{data: {update_path: plugin('inquiry').inquiries_path(params.merge(partial:true)), update_interval: 30}}</code>
      Controller:

        Controller should return a piece of html. For example you can provide an additional attribute on the url (partial) and react to it in the controller action to disable the layout.

        Example
        <code>respond_to do |format|
          format.html {
            if params[:partial]
              render partial: 'inquiries', locals: {inquiries: @inquiries, remote_links: true}, layout: false
            else
              render action: :index
            end
          }
          format.js
        end</code>

      #### Use plugin url helper

      Please use plugin url helper instead of generated url helpers.
      Instead of using <code>identity_plugin.projects_path</code> use <code>plugin('identity').projects_path</code>.
      The plugin helper retains the scope. It is possible to override the scope parameters by providing domain_id or project_id parameters.
      For example, to call domain path without including project_id in the scope you should call plugin('identity').domain_path(project_id: nil).

      #### Global list style removed

      I removed the global content list style with the neat blue boxes. It was causing too much trouble. If you want this for your lists add the class <code>.content-list</code> to your ul. Like this:

    %ul.content-list
      %li Fancy
      %li List
      %li Items

      #### Copy to Clipboard

      There is a new copy to clipboard functionality binded to the <code>pre</code> tag.

      #### Usage

      ```
      <pre class="snippet">
        <code>Your code/text to copy to the clipboard</code>
      </pre>
      ```

      #### Example
      <pre class="snippet">
        <code>Your code/text to copy to the clipboard</code>
      </pre>

      * <code>pages/home</code> is new domain home page (renamed from <code>start</code>)
      * there is a new project home page <code>pages/project_home</code>
      * Trying a new pattern for page headings. Remove <code>%h1.page-header</code> if you used them and instead use the new main_toolbar. You can add content to the toolbar (the area directly underneath the breadcrumb navigation) by using
        ```
        = content_for :main_toolbar do
        ```
        in your views. This is optional. If you don't do this then the main toolbar will show a humanized version of your controller name. For an example see <code>main_app/pages/home.html.haml</code>
      * Start of pattern for including info content from a plugin on the home page (you need to create a partial in your plugin in <code>/views/[plugin_name]/application/homepage_info_content</code>)
        **Important:** If you need to query your controller for information this needs to be done via Ajax. Andreas and Torsten are currently developing a pattern for this (will take a few more days)

      #### SASS instead of Sprockets!

      * Plugins should use SASS directives to import files.
        <code>
            @import "file_name";
        </code>
      * **DO NOT USE** <code>require</code>, <code>require_tree</code>, and <code>require_self</code>


      #### Namespace for Plugin's CCS classes

      All css classes inside a plugin are embedded in a namespace. So for example for a plugin called <code>my_plugin</code> the css class <code class="language-html">.test { ... }</code> becomes <code class="language-html">.my_plugin .test { ... }</code>

      #### Closures for Plugin's JS files
      * Every javascript file inside a plugin is embedded in a closure.
        For a plugin called my_plugin the closure looks as follows

        ```
        window.my_plugin = window.my_plugin || {};
        (function(){
          //... content of the file
        }).call(this);

        ```

      * All functions are visible inside the file

      * To make a function visible to outsie you should bind it to the variable my_plugin (replace my_plugin with the name of your plugin)
        <code> my_plugin.test = function() { ... } </code>
