## What is project Masterdata?

A project's master data encompasses various essential details about the project. The information in the "Cost Object" section is crucial for billing purposes. The data provided in other sections assists CCloud operations and support teams in identifying the appropriate contact persons in case of incidents, problems, or project-related inquiries. Additionally, this information indicates the project's significance to your operations, enabling the correct prioritization during major incidents. For example, this helps ensure that production systems are addressed before development systems when issues arise.
